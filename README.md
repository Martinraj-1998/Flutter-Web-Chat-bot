# Chat_bot web_app

This Flutter project serves as a web based chat-bot application for BinFin8 (potentially speaking). It aims to help the user learn more about BinFin8. The application uses DialogFlow backend service provided by Google Cloud Platform for Natural Language Processing and the Flutter framework for the user-interface.

**DialogFlow:**

The user messages and the app responses are configured as events in the DialogFlow dashboard. The DialogFlow service comes pre-loaded with a set of default responses for user messages such as "Hi" or "Hello". Moreover, if a message is not interpreted accurately a default response is displayed.
